==========================================================

Readdir is a minimal directory browser in just ~100 lines of VimL. To use it,
just open a directory and use Enter to change into directories or open files.

If you want to suppress Netrw (likely), add this to your `.vimrc`:

	let g:loaded_netrwPlugin = 1
